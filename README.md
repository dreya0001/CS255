The DriverPass project was to create a system for the company called DriverPass. The type of system they wanted to establish was a comprehensive dirver training program that users could access from online, as well as schedule and make drive appointments with instructors. The basis of this system is to improve the success rate of drivers. 

I felt I executed the creation of the ULM case diagram, I was able to capture the core functionailites and interations, helping visualize the system. 

I would pick the business document, I felt I did that early in the class and now that I am at the end and understand a lot better, I could improve the document. 

Interpreting the users needs and implementing them into my systems design was a critical moment when building my system. I wanted to listen to the clients needs, then make sure they all align with the task at hand. It is very important to consider the users needs when designing because you want a system that is user-friendly, if you make something too hard to use, noone will utlize the system you have created. 

My approach to designing software involves researching the clients needs, and making sure I am able to make these needs a reality. When designing I made sure that I had all the requirements needed and then get visual representation to clarify the systems structure and show that I am addressing all the functional and non functional aspects. The techniques I used throughout designing the system was communication, have the interviews with the clients and making sure the needs were met. I feel communication is vital to this type of work. Also the techniques of ULM diagrams helped me build the visual aspect and then made it easier for me to navigate through my system.
